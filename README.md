## Description

This site is intended to allow users to follow the top 200 Crypto's by market cap. In addition users can track their purchases of crypto by creating a position, updating, editing and deleting. The design, layout and typography are designed for pure intuitive funcionality for a clean and easy user expirience. However due to the complex nature of finance money and on-top crypto, I feel that the site could imporove UX. 

Please note for now the only currency available on the site is USD.

The site is far from finished but due to time constraits this is as far as I can take it for now.

## UX

* As site owner, the objective is to provide a simple soultion for crypto fans to follow their favorite 'coins'. In doing so create traffic to the site for potentional add or subscription revenue. 

* As a visitor, the objective of the website to provide a simple, visual content with intutive design, of the users holdings of cryptos. The user should be able to browse the current top 200. View lastest info provided by the API and preform full CRUD capabilities on their holdings.

## Deployment

This site was developed using VScode IDE. All changes to the code were then added and committed to the local repository. The commits were then pushed to my GitHub repository and the project deployed using GtiHub pages as follows;

Step 1: Go to the settings tab of the repo, scrolled down to GitHub Pages

Step 2: Under GitHub Pages -> Source is a scrolldown box titled None. Click it and you can select a source.

Step 3: Click master branch

Step 4: You will be automatically taken to the top of the page where in a light blue bar will be stated "Github Pages source saved".

Step 5: You then scroll down to GitHub Pages where will be stated "Your site is ready to be published at "<https://nickbell123.github.io/">

Step 6: Click on the url and you will be auto-referred to the published webpage.

Step 7: When returning to the github repository settings, scroll down to GitHub Pages and you will see a light green block stating "Your site is published at <https://...">
