## Description

This site is intended to allow users to follow the top 200 Crypto's by market cap. In addition users can track their purchases of crypto by creating a position, updating, editing and deleting. The design, layout and typography are designed for pure intuitive funcionality for a clean and easy user expirience. However due to the complex nature of finance, money and on-top crypto, I feel that the site could improve on UX. 

Please note for now the only currency available on the site is USD.

The site is far from finished but due to time constraits this is as far as I can take it for now.

## UX

* As site owner, the objective is to provide a simple soultion for crypto fans to follow their favorite 'coins'. In doing so create traffic to the site for potentional add or subscription revenue. 

* As a visitor, the objective of the website to provide a simple, visual content with intutive design, of the users holdings of cryptos. The user should be able to browse the current top 200. View lastest info provided by the API and preform full CRUD capabilities on their holdings.

Step 2: Under GitHub Pages -> Source is a scrolldown box titled None. Click it and you can select a source.
